Hi {full_name},

I hope you’re doing well.

I’m writing to follow up on the status of my application for opportunities at Goldman Sachs. Thank you for your earlier response confirming receipt of my application and for guiding me on how to track its progress through the applicant dashboard.

However, I haven’t yet received any updates regarding the next steps in the hiring process, and the status on the portal remains unchanged. I would really appreciate it if you could share any updates on my application status or provide an estimated timeline for the upcoming steps, if available.

Thank you again for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.
